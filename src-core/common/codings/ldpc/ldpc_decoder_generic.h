             * d_phi_step = 16 gives 1/16 resolution in the argument, which is
             * essential for the INVERSE lookup: the summed φ values (phi_excl) are
             * often small (< 1), and with a coarse integer-indexed table they all
             * rounded to index 0 and returned the saturated max, over-correcting and
             * preventing convergence at low SNR.
             *
             * Because φ is its own inverse, the same table serves both lookups:

             * d_phi_scale = 1024 keeps the small-magnitude φ values (which dominate
             * the check-node sum) in a range that fits int16 while preserving enough
             * precision. d_phi_lut_max saturates φ(0)=∞ to a value that, after
             * dividing back by d_phi_scale, gives a check-node output magnitude
             * comparable to the channel LLRs (roughly tens).
